      Write a function that will have three different promises that will have
      timeouts respectively at 1, 2 and 3 seconds. Each promise will console log
      When they are ALL fulfilled; output to the console: First promise, second
      promise, etc. Write an async function that will wait for the result of all
      of those and print the results to console.
